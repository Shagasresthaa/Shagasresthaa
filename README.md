## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🌑 Exoplanet Detection using Multimodel Neural Networks
This project is an early attempt to try to classify if a light curve of transit could be an exoplanetary transit candidate. A revamp will be made soon when time permits!

## 🌟 Current Projects I'm Working On

### 🪐 ORBITS Library
This project aims to provide an accurate enough API to simulate and research orbits and orbital mechanics and personally a way to understand better the 2-body, 3 body and N-body problems

### 📐 CALMAT_LIB
This project aims to provide an accurate enough API for performing basic to advanced math calculus functions and beyond

### 🛠️ Portfolio Website Revamp
Just my personal website for showcasing projects and having fun! Currently rebuilding it from scratch, transitioning from a legacy Django codebase to a (probably overkill) microservice-based containerized full-stack application. Also expanding it to host my blog and articles.
