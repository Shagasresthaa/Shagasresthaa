### Greetings, I'm Sresthaa!
<p align="justify">I'm a Master's Student currently pursuing my Degree in the field of Computer Science at Western Michigan University. My focus on the core study is varied in various fields with the common target being the application of said skills in InterDisciplinary Fields. My primary areas of study are in Low Level Systems Design, Embedded Systems, Artificial Intelligence Applications and High Performance Computing. I have worked across various fields from AI applications in Astronomy to On Prem Administration as a part of my University Developer Club to Full Stack Development and DevOps with Enterprise Systems of Oracle and AWS. I'm always excited to learn more about interdisciplinary applications of Computer Science and put said skills to use by challenging myself in various ways by means of projects or employment or academic contexts. Wanna connect with me? Do drop a Follow or Connection Request on LinkedIn or even drop an Email! Cheers! </p>
